            <h2><q>AI stabilizes satellite internet connectivity</q></h2>
            <p>University of Waterloo researchers used artificial intelligence to determine potential problems with satellite internet systems. Peng Hu, Waterloo adjunct professor of computer science, and his team tested two other technologies to confirm their findings. They concluded this prevention ensures Canada’s remote areas maintain connectivity.

            Technologies often build on top of one another to create new ones. Others enhance existing gadgets and apps like satellite internet in Canada. Soon, this technology could improve connectivity in other countries. You might enjoy this upgrade in your area in the coming years, so learn now how it works.
            <br><br>
            This article will discuss how researchers developed their AI satellite internet solution. Later, I will cover an emerging form of internet service built by Google and NASA.<br><br></p>
            <b><p class="me">How does the AI satellite internet work?</b></p>

           <p>The University of Waterloo website explained the problem the AI satellite internet solved. It said rural Canadian communities depend on satellites to access the Internet.
           <br><br>
           Their connectivity is unreliable due to frequent glitches and service interruptions. Consequently, they usually have a worse experience than city people.<br><br>That service inequality is severely detrimental to Canada’s economic productivity. That is why Peng Hu and a few National Research Council experts tackled this issue with machine learning.
           <br><br>
           They created an AI method called the Multivariate Variance-based Genetic Ensemble Learning Method. It merges multiple existing AI-driven models to identify satellite and satellite network issues before they grow into major problems.
           <br><br>
           “For remote areas in Canada and around the world, satellites are often their best option for maintaining internet access,” said Peng Hu. “The problem is that the operation of those satellites can be expensive and time-consuming, and issues with them can lead to populations being cut off from the rest of the world.”</p>
