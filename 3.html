  <p>MANILA, Philippines — Environmental and advocacy groups are warning holiday shoppers against buying uncertified Christmas lights that are not only potentially toxic but also fire hazards as well as plastic toys containing a banned ingredient.
  <br><br>
  The Ecowaste Coalition said that 10 of the 15 Christmas lights it bought in Binondo, Manila, and in Libertad, Pasay City, lacked the Philippine Standard (PS) mark or Import Commodity Clearance (ICC) sticker, while two of the uncertified products were also without a label.<br><br>The group warned that the absence of a PS mark or ICC sticker meant that the products did not go through the required certification process of the Bureau of Philippine Standards and might not be compliant with quality and safety standards.
  <br><br>
  Purchased for P100 to P250 per set, the 10 uncertified products were Crown Star Decorative Lights, GTP Great Power Solar String Light, Joy Origin LED Solar Energy, LED Solar Light, Multi-Function LED Lights, Solar Powered String Lights, NuoDalk LED Solar String Light, Wish Star Solar String Lights, and two unlabeled products.<br><br><b>More than the limit</b><br><br>Ecowaste also said that using an x-ray fluorescence analyzer which determines the elemental composition of materials, it found lead in the green cables linking the Christmas lights in nine of the products.
  <br><br>
  The toxic chemical ranged from 3,220 to 8,440 parts per million (ppm), higher than the 1,000 ppm limit under the European Union’s Restriction of Hazardous Substances (RoHS) in all electrical and electronic products.
  <br><br>
  The RoHS specifies the levels for restricted substances in electrical and electronic products such as heavy metals cadmium, hexavalent chromium, lead, and mercury, among others.
  <br><br>
  <q>Choose Christmas lights with a valid PS mark or ICC sticker for the safety of your family this festive season,” Ecowaste said, adding that “it was better to be safe than sorry later.</q></p>
